# ROS2 by Projects

This website aims to provide resources to steadily understand most concepts revolving around ROS2 by tackling them independantly and letting learners experience by writing themselves a dedicated package. To achieve this, the content will be sliced in several modules, each tackling the subject with several robot: from simple simulation robots to manipulate small bits of code, to real robots to slowly fade into industries actual tasks.
