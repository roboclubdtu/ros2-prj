# Core 1: Basics Concept

In this module, you will learn the base of ROS2: what are its key components, how to write small packages and simulate some robots.
The aim is to dig deeper inside the ROS icerberg by writing the first portion of code. However we still won't tackle topics that are still to complex yet as physical simulation, advanced CMake configurations, or the creation of custom messages.

## Chapters
