<h1 align="center">ROS2 by Projects</h1>

## Overview

This repository contains the source code of the online tutorials to learn ROS2 through projects. It aims to provide resources to steadily understand every concept revolving around ROS2 by tackling them independantly and letting learners experience by writing themselves a dedicated package.

The tutorials will be splitted in several modules:

- **Core 0:** ROS2 Overview
- **Core 1:** Basics concepts
- **Core 2:** Advanced Concepts
- **Core 3:** Specialized packages
  - **a:** Manipulator robots and MoveIt
  - **b:** Mobile robots and Nav2
- **Core 4:** Diverse and advanced topics (that doesn't fit in other category)

The website is available [here (DTU Roboclub website)](https://roboclubdtu.github.io/ros2-prj).

## This repository

This repository is mainly maintained by Geoffrey @Meltwin CÃ´te. It is published under the DTU Roboclub name for all students. I am just making this project because I'd like to spread the usage and understanding of ROS2 across the students, especially in university that do not teach it. Anyone that want to use, improve or help building this website is welcome as the task is a bit tedious.

It is published under the MIT Licence.
