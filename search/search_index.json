Indeed, everytime you'll want to launch a ROS executable you made, or a whole stack for a robot, or even for some simple debugging or testing, you'll need to go through the command line. So it's important that you experience it from the beginning.</p> <p>Warning</p> <p>Before going further, you should maybe familiarize yourself more with the shell terminal as you will sometimes have to switch between directories, quickly edit a file, or setup environment variables. Classic command would be:</p> <ul> <li><code>ls</code>: to get a list of the file in the directory,</li> <li><code>cd &lt;dir&gt;</code>: to navigate between directories (e.g. <code>cd mydir</code> or <code>cd ..</code> to move to the parent directory),</li> <li><code>rm &lt;file&gt;</code>: to permantly delete a file from the disk. If you want to delete a whole directory instead, use <code>rm -r &lt;dir&gt;</code>,</li> <li><code>mv &lt;old location&gt; &lt;new location&gt;</code>: to move a file from the old location to the new location.</li> </ul> <p>You should also know how to read command line arguments help. The format is very popular you might have already encountered it. For example, the command <code>foo &lt;bar&gt; [-j &lt;K&gt; ...]</code> (this is not a real command, so it won't work in your terminal) can be read it as:</p> <ul> <li><code>foo</code> is a static term so you should write it directly,</li> <li><code>&lt;bar&gt;</code> is a mandatory argument so you should replace it by the corresponding value,</li> <li><code>[-j &lt;K&gt;]</code> is an optional argument so you should add this part only if you need it, and replace <code>&lt;K&gt;</code> by the correct value,</li> <li><code>...</code> means that the latest argument can accept several values at once.</li> </ul> <p>So for example, commands that would follow the right pattern would be <code>foo test</code>, <code>foo myvar -j 5</code> or <code>foo barvar -j 8 60 3 4 6</code>. </p>"},{"location":"core1/cmd/#introduction","title":"Introduction","text":"<p>Following what was made for ROS1, a console executable <code>ros2</code> providing the essential tools for ROS developper has been made.

You can then know all entities on the network, and get more info about each of them. You can apply these two commands with the following syntax:</p> <ul> <li><code>ros2 [node, topic, service, action] list</code>: that will give you a full list of the wanted entities,</li> <li><code>ros2 [node, topic, action] info &lt;entity name&gt;</code>: that will give you more detailed information.</li> </ul> <p>Now, let's put this in practice. As services and actions are more complex, let's put them aside for now.
